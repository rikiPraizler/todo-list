* Responsibilities of Each Class
 Order - Manage order status, calculate total amount, store list of order items
 OrderItem - Calculate item price (quantity * price), be part of an order
 Payment - Ensure payment belongs to an existing order, update order status to PAID after successful payment
 Customer - Manage customer details, identify orders belonging to the customer

* How to Ensure a Payment is Linked to the Correct Order
 1. Check that the order exists – Payment.orderId must match an existing Order.id.
 2. Verify payment amount – Payment.amount must match Order.totalAmount.
 3. Update order status only after successful payment – if Payment.status = SUCCESS, then set Order.status = PAID.
